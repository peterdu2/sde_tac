For both params we see a p safety score of around 0.58 (0.578366 and 0.575633 respectively). 
Here we define p-safety slightly differently and consider the points where the probability of reaching the unsafe
set is exactly equation to p (0.58). Our unsafe set is anything outside of [1,10] and we consider a time limit 
of 2 (T=2) when calulating p-safety. While both intitial conditions have the same p-safety, they diff in their exit
time distributions. Through our SDP formulation, params1 has first and second moments: 1.955 and 4.172. Params2 has:
2.147 and 5.634. While they have similar first moments, params2 has noticeably higher second moment indicating a 
larger spread of the exit time distribution. Due to their similar first moments, this indicates that the second set
of parameters may possess increased mass at lower exit times and thus suggests the system may be more susceptible to
unsafe behaviour. 

The histograms of exit times obtained through monte carlo simulation supports this. We see a concentration of mass 
in very low exit times in params2. This is supported by the increased magnitude of the noise component in 
params2. The larger weight means that initially, the system has a higher opportunity to exit through the "upper end"
of the safe set (i.e. x > 10). We note that the system naturally decays to a mean at 0 over time and thus the system 
only possess a high chance of exit from the upper end at the beginning.
